# After zero previous programming knowledge and 
# studying Beginning Ruby by Cooper, this is what I came up with
#
# This program will ask for your name and favorite number
# Then it will print your name the same number of times as your favorite number
#
puts "What is your name?"
  name = gets.chomp
  puts "What is your favorite number? "
  fav_num = gets.chomp; fav_num.to_i
  puts "We will now print your name #{fav_num} times: ";
  favorite = fav_num.to_i
  favorite.times do puts name
